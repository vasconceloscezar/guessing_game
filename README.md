## Guessing game 

A simple game where you can guess a number between 1 and 100. 

This was my first code written in Rust, following [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). 

With this piece of code I could learn some concepts like: 
- Cargo  
- let and mut 
- match 
- loop
- script function
- crates
- Result enum 
- Rng
- Ordering


## Want to try it? 

- Clone repo 
- Install [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- Run the following commands: 
```
$ cargo build 
$ cargo run
```

Enjoy.
